# Spree Multi Vendor

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spree-contrib/spree_multi_vendor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/spree-contrib/spree_multi_vendor)

This is a [spree multi vendor marketplace](https://spreecommerce.org/use-cases/multi-vendor-marketplace/) extension. It's a great starting point if you're building a marketplace on top of [Spree](https://spreecommerce.org). Our goal was flexibility to allow you to tweak it to your needs.

Check out this extension [multi vendor marketplace demo](https://spreecommerce.org/launch-a-multi-vendor-marketplace-within-a-few-weeks-with-spree-commerce/) and launch your marketplace within weeks, not months.

## Features

By default you can create and manage Vendors who can manage on their own:

- [X] Orders
- [X] Products
- [X] Stock Locations
- [X] Shipping Methods
- [X] Vendor profile

Also:
- [X] Super Admins can assign Users to Vendors
- [X] You can modify which permissions and models/resources Vendors can manage quite easily

Contributions welcome! :)

## Installation

1. Add this extension to your Gemfile with this line:
    ```ruby
    gem 'spree_multi_vendor'
    ```

2. Install the gem using Bundler:
    ```ruby
    bundle install
    ```

3. Copy & run migrations
    ```ruby
    bundle exec rails g spree_multi_vendor:install
    ```

4. Restart your server

    If your server was running, restart it so that it can find the assets properly.

5. Optionally you can also create sample Vendor by running:

   ```bash
   bundle exec rake spree_multi_vendor:sample:create
   ```

## Upgrading

1. Fetch new database migrations:

    ```bash
    bundle exec rake railties:install:migrations FROM=spree_multi_vendor
    ```

2. Run migrations

    ```bash
    bundle exec rails db:migrate
    ```

## Configuration

To change which models should be vendorized, in your Spree initializer (`config/initializers/spree.rb`) add:

```ruby
SpreeMultiVendor::Config[:vendorized_models] = %w[product variant stock_location shipping_method other_model]
```

This will lookup for `Spree::OtherModel` class. To add `vendor_id` column to that model run:

```bash
bundle exec rails g migration AddVendorToSpreeOtherModels vendor:references
```

## API endpoints

Spree Multi Vendor adds new [API v2](https://api.spreecommerce.org/docs/api-v2/api/docs/v2/storefront/index.yaml) endpoints:

1. `GET` Display Vendor information endpoint
    
     ```
     /api/v2/storefront/vendors/<vendor_slug>
     ```
     
     eg. `/api/v2/storefront/vendors/test-vendor`

     you can also include Vendor image and/or Products in that call:

     `/api/v2/storefront/vendors/test-vendor?include=image,products`

And modfies existing:

1. `GET` Filtering Products by Vendor ID(s):

    ```
    /api/v2/storefront/products?filter[vendor_ids]=1,2,3
    ```

2. `GET` Include Vendor information in Cart endpoint:

    ```
    /api/v2/storefront/cart?include=vendors,vendor_totals
    ```

## Email previews

Spree offers emails preview generator for development purposes.
To generate them, use command:

`bundle exec rails g spree_multi_vendor:mailers_preview`

After that, start rails server locally and go to:
`localhost:3000/rails/mailers`

(it requires seeded development database in order to work properly)

## Testing

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_multi_vendor/factories'
```
